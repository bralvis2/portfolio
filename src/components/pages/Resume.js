                <p>As a novice web developer, I am thrilled to present my resume showcasing my 
                    skills, work experience, education, and interests in the world of web development. 
                    With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I have a passion for creating 
                    visually appealing and user-friendly websites. My recent work experience has allowed 
                    me to apply my knowledge in a practical setting, collaborating with teams and 
                    contributing to the development of engaging web applications</p>
